      Not to be mistaken with pseudo-classes, pseudo-elements allow you to style certain parts of a document. We can style after or before an element, the first letter or first line, the selection and the backdrop. Originally in CSS1 and CSS2 the pseudo -elements
      started with a colon (:) which was the same as pseudo-classes. To separate the two in CSS3 pseudo elements now start with a double colon (::) this is not supported in all versions of Internet Explorer, and you can still use one colon.

        <h2>Why is it called a Pseudo-Element?</h2>
        <p> The word pseudo is a Greek word that stands for “lying, false” and an element in HTML could be a paragraph or a header. Put the two together and we create an alternative description of a false paragraph or a false header and this is what the pseudo-element
          is, a fake element which alters your HTML after load.
